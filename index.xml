      <title>Project 7: Face Mask Detection</title>

      <description>Objective: In this project I tried to make use of deep learning to detect mask on people&amp;rsquo;s face as we are in the middle of a pandemic. My aim was to use this technology at Hospitals, Malls, Shoppping Centers, Railway Stations and Airports etc. to restrict people who are not wearing a mask.
Procedure I used a pretrained &amp;ldquo;VGG16 model&amp;rdquo; to train the model for mask detection. Then I used opencv to detect the face and apply our model to detect mask.</description>

      <title>Project 8: E-commerce Product Classifcation Using Images and Texts.</title>

      <description>Problem Statement: This problem comes under the category of multi-label classification and product retrieval. Sometimes product&amp;rsquo;s textual data (product title &amp;amp; description) is helpful for this task, and sometimes product&amp;rsquo;s images help. Hence, we need a Deep learning model which takes into account both the products image and text. This is why a multi-modal deep-learning method is required, with its help we can generates such embeddings that comprises of both the product&amp;rsquo;s text and image representation which can help in further downstream tasks for classification and product retrieval.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement: Here we have two images i.e content image and style image and we need to generate an art like paintings by using the power of neural networks.
Example           Fig 1. Content Image              Fig 2. Style Image    Fig 1. is content image and Fig 2.</description>

      <title>Project 6: Big Mart Sales Prediction</title>

      <description>Problem Statement: BigMart have collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.
Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.
Interesting Insights:           Fig 1.</description>

      <title>Project 4: Santander Customer Transaction Prediction</title>

      <description>Problem Statement: Santander is bank where mission is to help people and businesses prosper. In this challenge, we need to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.
Interesting Insights: In this project target variable was highly imbalanced hence I used Smote Upsampling method to upsample minority class. We also used &amp;ldquo;F1-score&amp;rdquo; error metric and &amp;ldquo;ROC Curve&amp;rdquo; for model evaluation as accuracy isn&amp;rsquo;t a good metric when we have imbalnced dataset.</description>

      <title>Project 3: Cab Fare Prediction</title>
      <link>https://1sh1vam.github.io/zport/post/chapter-3/</link>

      <description>Problem Statement: There is a cab rental start-up company which wants to launch a cab service. They have successfully run the pilot project and now want to launch their cab service across the country. They have collected the historical data from their pilot project and now have a requirement to apply analytics for fare prediction. The aim of the project is to design a system that predicts the fare amount for a cab ride in the city.</description>
