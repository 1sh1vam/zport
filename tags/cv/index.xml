      <description>Objective: In this project I tried to make use of deep learning to detect mask on people&amp;rsquo;s face as we are in the middle of a pandemic. My aim was to use this technology at Hospitals, Malls, Shoppping Centers, Railway Stations and Airports etc. to restrict people who are not wearing a mask.
Procedure I used a pretrained &amp;ldquo;VGG16 model&amp;rdquo; to train the model for mask detection. Then I used opencv to detect the face and apply our model to detect mask.</description>

      <title>Project 8: E-commerce Product Classifcation Using Images and Texts.</title>

      <description>Problem Statement: This problem comes under the category of multi-label classification and product retrieval. Sometimes product&amp;rsquo;s textual data (product title &amp;amp; description) is helpful for this task, and sometimes product&amp;rsquo;s images help. Hence, we need a Deep learning model which takes into account both the products image and text. This is why a multi-modal deep-learning method is required, with its help we can generates such embeddings that comprises of both the product&amp;rsquo;s text and image representation which can help in further downstream tasks for classification and product retrieval.</description>
