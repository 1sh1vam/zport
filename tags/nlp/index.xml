      <description>Problem Statement: This problem comes under the category of multi-label classification and product retrieval. Sometimes product&amp;rsquo;s textual data (product title &amp;amp; description) is helpful for this task, and sometimes product&amp;rsquo;s images help. Hence, we need a Deep learning model which takes into account both the products image and text. This is why a multi-modal deep-learning method is required, with its help we can generates such embeddings that comprises of both the product&amp;rsquo;s text and image representation which can help in further downstream tasks for classification and product retrieval.</description>
