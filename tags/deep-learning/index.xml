      <description>Objective: In this project I tried to make use of deep learning to detect mask on people&amp;rsquo;s face as we are in the middle of a pandemic. My aim was to use this technology at Hospitals, Malls, Shoppping Centers, Railway Stations and Airports etc. to restrict people who are not wearing a mask.
Procedure I used a pretrained &amp;ldquo;VGG16 model&amp;rdquo; to train the model for mask detection. Then I used opencv to detect the face and apply our model to detect mask.</description>

      <title>Project 8: E-commerce Product Classifcation Using Images and Texts.</title>

      <description>Problem Statement: This problem comes under the category of multi-label classification and product retrieval. Sometimes product&amp;rsquo;s textual data (product title &amp;amp; description) is helpful for this task, and sometimes product&amp;rsquo;s images help. Hence, we need a Deep learning model which takes into account both the products image and text. This is why a multi-modal deep-learning method is required, with its help we can generates such embeddings that comprises of both the product&amp;rsquo;s text and image representation which can help in further downstream tasks for classification and product retrieval.</description>

      <title>Project 5: Neural Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://1sh1vam.github.io/zport/post/chapter-5/</link>

      <description>Problem Statement: Here we have two images i.e content image and style image and we need to generate an art like paintings by using the power of neural networks.
Example           Fig 1. Content Image              Fig 2. Style Image    Fig 1. is content image and Fig 2.</description>
